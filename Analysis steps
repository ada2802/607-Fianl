Goals:
	1. We propose to analyze the issue around New York City (including Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Bronx) by frequency of reported incidents in each area.
	2. We will look for what factors correlate the incidents type and residents (for example, race, age, and income), environments (business, living, nature, etc.).
	3. Time and weather may be an important factors about incidents, we will look into it too.
Methods: 1. We will collect the data through reliable websites and then clean and tidings data.
	2. Before analysis we will store the date in useful database like MongoDB, Neo4j or MySQL.
	3. We will use RStudio or Jpyther as main tool in analysis. We may use Spark to connect to MongoDB
	4. Statistical methods will be applied in our analysis, such as cluster analysis, PCA. (could be more)
	5. We may use R package such as iGraph or ggplot2 / Tableau Public (Free)/ PowerBI Desktop (Free) to present our results.

Data clearing
	Clearing in R and save the data to a DB

Data analyst
		(if we do these in a map, it could be best for 1 & 2., R or tableau)
	Map data :http://www.milanor.net/blog/maps-in-r-plotting-data-points-on-a-map/

	1. 311 calls Volume (Frequency, scrabble)  - by cities, type of issues and monthly 
	2. Use the Neo4j to show the link of the cities and issues (node - city or issue)
	Here, we need to calculate the percentages of the types of issues ( or deeper level by zip code) 
	-> propose on % and advice the location public service expending and police arrangement…
	
	(… something I forget here) (maybe use simulation to estimate the 311 calls.

	 

	3. Analyst the correlation of variables - Scale plot (prepare the data for multiply linear models)  
	Multiply Linear regression model - (may do hypothesis test + A/B test) 
	Estimate the #of calls

	4. K-Mean Cluster analysis - which areas have similar environment( population & income) and issues

	5. PCA analyst (vs k-mean cluster analysis by K variables and # of components in PCA )
